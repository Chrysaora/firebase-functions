Hi {{firstName}}!

Thank you for volunteering to deliver groceries to our neighbors with Bed-Stuy
Strong!

We've assigned you Route {{routeName}} with the following tickets:
{{ticketIDs}}

### Instructions

This coming Saturday, please come to the Brooklyn Packers warehouse at **[221
Glenmore Ave, Gate 4]({{{warehouseMapsUrl}}}) at {{arrivalTime}}** to pick up
your deliveries. Since there are perishables in the deliveries, you'll need to
deliver them immediately after pickup.

You'll load your car with boxes for the above ticket IDs, and then deliver them
to the addresses below. You may want to plan your route to Brooklyn Packers and
then to the delivery locations in advance.

The neighbors you're delivering to have confirmed their availability for
1:30-4pm, but you'll call each of them before you leave the warehouse, to get
any last minute delivery details. 

If possible, we recommend printing this email out so you can mark tickets done
as you complete them, to fill out the [Completion
Form](https://airtable.com/shrvHf4k5lRo0I8F4) at the end. If any issues come up
during your deliveries, or you are unable to deliver any of the boxes (because
someone isn't home) contact Jackson at {{warehouseCoordinatorPhone}}. We'll help
you redistribute the food to the community in another way.

### Checklist

- [ ] Check in with Hanna or Jackson at the warehouse when you arrive. They'll
      let you know when your boxes are ready. While you're waiting:
- [ ] Call the recipients of each ticket to make sure they're available. If
      they're not, please let Jackson or Hanna know -- we'll use their items for
      someone else, and deliver to them another time. 
- [ ] At the warehouse, for each household get some of the following (we'll tell
      you):
    - [ ] Main food boxes (may be multiple per household)
    - [ ] Cleaning supplies
    - [ ] Custom items
    - [ ] Water
- [ ] Confirm all the ticket IDs match, and have your route number/name on them.
- [ ] Put everything in your car
- [ ] Check off each delivery below as you complete it
- [ ] Fill out the delivery completion form when you're done
