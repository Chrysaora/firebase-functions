      <h2>New Member Sign Up</h2>
      <p>
        Bed-Stuy Strong (BSS) is a mutual aid network of neighbors helping neighbors in a spirit of solidarity. All of our
        members are ordinary folks giving and receiving help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since COVID-19 hit NYC in March 2020, hundreds of BSS members have been part of various projects in Bed-Stuy like
        grocery delivery, expanding wifi access, trash clean up, and civic engagement in protests, voting, and the census.
        Members also directly support each other by redistributing resources (like air conditioners, winter clothing, baby
        clothes, and rent assistance) within our neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>
      	<a href="/principles">Our Guiding Principles</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We move in <strong>solidarity</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            We do the work <strong>humbly</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            We draw on our neighborhood’s legacy of <strong>resourcefulness</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
          	We are <strong>accountable</strong> to and show <strong>care</strong>, for each other, and to neighbors who seek our support, particularly those who have been historically excluded by systems of power.
          </li>
          <li>
            We hold space for <strong>joyful, compassionate, imaginative</strong> work and thinking.
          </li>

      </p>
      <p>
        As a BSS member, you are lovingly encouraged to move in solidarity with neighbors by asking for help when you need it,
        and providing support when you’re able to.
      </p>
      <h3>Donation</h3>
      <p>
        While we don’t require membership dues, BSS relies on financial resource redistribution, and member contributions are
        greatly appreciated. As and when you’re able, you can donate to our community fund via ioby (tax-deductible), Venmo,
        Paypal or Cashapp to help continue our mutual aid work. Every dollar received is used to purchase groceries and basic
        supplies for our most vulnerable neighbors, 85% of whom are elderly, immunocompromised, or disabled.
      </p>
      <h3>Volunteering</h3>
      <p>
        Volunteering is another great way to have a direct impact on the safety and well-being of many Brooklynites experiencing
        hardship. There are lots of ways to get involved.
