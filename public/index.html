    <p>
      Bed-Stuy Strong is a group of neighbors helping neighbors in a spirit of solidarity. We are a mutual aid network of over
      4,000 people from across Bed-Stuy who are supporting each other and our communities during the COVID-19 crisis. We crowdsource donations
      and use them to provide no-contact grocery deliveries for vulnerable members of our Bed-Stuy communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of our members are ordinary folks volunteering their time and effort. We are not a government agency or a
      non-profit. You can <a href="/principles">learn more about our guiding principles here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the times, Bed-Stuy Strong faces an incredible amount of need in our communities. Every day we receive hundreds of
      calls. We spend several thousand dollars daily to try to make sure our neighbors do not go hungry. We ask for your
      patience and support as we try to connect our community’s help to our community’s need.
    </p>
    <h2 id="need">I am in need.</h2>
    <p>
      If you live in Bed-Stuy and are experiencing hunger, please leave us a voicemail or send a text message to
      <a href="tel:9174515522">917-451-5522</a>.
      We will call you back to coordinate a no-contact delivery of essential groceries or medical supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our thoughts are with you. We apologize that we can’t meet your request immediately. We have received thousands of
      messages and respond in the order that requests are received, so there is no need to leave multiple voicemails.
    </p>
    <p> 
      To avoid long waits for callers, as of mid-January 2021,
      we have moved to a set number of weekly food delivery slots, based on the number of people who can deliver. 
      Our phone line opens once a week, and closes once we have reached our capacity to deliver for the week; 
      you can call <a href="tel:9174515522">917-451-5522</a> to find out what date and time the phone line will open. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand that you might need food quicker than we can get it to you. 
      If you are experiencing hunger right now, please see our below list of food resources in Bed-Stuy or go to <a href="http://nyc.gov/getFood">NYC.gov/getFood</a>.
      If you would like to hear a list of these resources over the phone, please call <a href="tel:9174515522">917-451-5522</a>.
      Thank you for your patience. Our thoughts are with you.

      A detailed list of food assistance options in Bed-Stuy and citywide is available here:

    </h3>
    <p>
      Anyone willing to go to a grocery store to shop for another person and be reimbursed for the shopping out
      of our community fund can become a Bed-Stuy Strong delivery volunteer; multiple delivery volunteers have also received food support. More delivery volunteers
      mean that more people can get food each week. See below for details on how to join. Bed-Stuy Strong is built on the belief that all of us have needs and all of us 
      can offer help. We believe in community care, joined hands, and dignity afford to all people.

    <h2 id="vaccine"> NEW: I need support to get a vaccine or want to support my elders in getting a vaccine </h2>
    <p>
      We know that it isn't easy for everyone to navigate the technology and changing requirements of getting vaccinated, especially elders.
      Some Bed-Stuy neighbors are piloting a new initiative to help connect elders 65+ and older with available vaccination appointment slots. Here are the details:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Check if you or the neighbor or family member in question is eligible. Neighbors who are eligible MUST be 65 and older
          AND be able to prove residency in the following zip codes:
          11203, 11205, 11206, 11207, 11208, 11212, 11216, 11220, 11221, 11224, 11226, 11232, 11233, 11235, 11236, 11237, 11238,
          and 11239.
        </li>
        <li>Eligible people must be willing to travel to Canarsie High School this Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, between 10am and noon.</li>
        <li>
          To request an appointment, text VACCINE4N to 917-810-2337 before 6pm, Tuesday February 16, 2021, with the full name and
          number of the eligible neighbor or family member to receive
          a call back. We will call them back with more details and help connect them with any available appointments, which may
          run out before you call. A lot of people are trying to get vaccinated right now.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bear with us as we do our best, as regular people volunteering time and effort, to support you. We cannot currently help
          connect folks outside of the above zip codes with vaccine appointments.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h2 id="donate">I want to donate.</h2>
    <p>
      One hundred percent of donations to Bed-Stuy Strong are used to purchase groceries and basic supplies for vulnerable
      neighbors. Households then receive what they need from our network of delivery volunteers – ordinary Bed-Stuy residents
      who are looking to help members of their community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are grateful for every contribution. Every dollar you give has a direct impact on the safety and well-being of our
      Bed-Stuy neighbors. Since our founding in March, Bed-Stuy Strong has purchased and delivered a week’s supply of
      groceries for over 22,000 neighbors, providing an estimated half a million meals. Many of the neighbors we've served are elderly,
      immunocompromised, or disabled.

      Beyond our mutual aid operation, our online Slack community is also a place for neighbors to connect, share information,
      organize virtual events, and more. In a time of social distancing, Bed-Stuy Strong believes in the power of staying
      connected as a community.

      As unemployment and economic hardship continues to grow due to the COVID-19 crisis, we are continuing to evolve to
      ensure we can continue supporting our neighbors in need. As part of this evolution, we are exploring potential
      partnerships with Brooklyn-based organizations and businesses that have expertise in food provision and distribution and
      access to physical space. If you’re interested in discussing partnership opportunities, please email us at
      <a href="mailto:partnerships@bedstuystrong.com">partnerships@bedstuystrong.com</a>.
